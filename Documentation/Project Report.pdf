# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project is a **Data Analysis on Zomato Restaurant Data** using Python. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing customer preferences based on restaurant types, online orders, and costs for two people. Additionally, we provide visual insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Zomato-data-.csv
- **Size:** **149 rows**
- **Columns:** Name, Online Order, Book Table, Rate, Votes, Approx Cost (For Two People), Listed In(Type)

## âœ… Key Tasks Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Capitalized text** for column values.
- **Standardized column headers**.
- **Removed extra spaces** in column names.
- **Dropped duplicates** to ensure clean data.
- **Cleaned the Rate column** by removing unwanted text and converting it to numeric.

### 2. Data Analysis
- **Top 10 Restaurants by Votes** to see the most popular places.
- **Average Cost Analysis** to find the approximate cost for two people.
- **Category-wise Count Analysis** to see how many restaurants fall into different categories.
- **Online Order Availability Analysis** to see how many restaurants offer online ordering.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
This project also contains visualizations generated using Python libraries (Matplotlib & Seaborn), including:
- **Top 10 Restaurants by Votes**
- **Cost Distribution for Two People**
- **Restaurant Type Count Analysis**

ðŸ‘‰ **All visualizations were created as part of my analysis** to better understand customer preferences.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Numpy** for numeric operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
