# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is a **Data Analysis on Zomato Restaurant Data** using Python. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing customer preferences based on restaurant types, online orders, and costs for two people. Additionally, we provide visual insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 💾 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Zomato-data-.csv
- **Size:** **149 rows**
- **Columns:** Name, Online Order, Book Table, Rate, Votes, Approx Cost (For Two People), Listed In(Type)

## ✅ Key Tasks Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Capitalized text** for column values.
- **Standardized column headers**.
- **Removed extra spaces** in column names.
- **Dropped duplicates** to ensure clean data.
- **Cleaned the Rate column** by removing unwanted text and converting it to numeric.

### 2. Data Analysis
